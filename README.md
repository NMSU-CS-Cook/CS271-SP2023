# In Class Examples for CS 271 SP2023

This repo will contain code that we create while doing in-class example programming. This means that there will be lots of small unrelated programs in this repo, not just one project.

Not necessarily all code during the semester will be here (some may just be throwaway code), and we might work on some larger projects that end up in their own repo.
